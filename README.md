# MYQUIZZAPP-S
Hi, I am attaching the desired results(including the bonus section) in the form of QUIZOUTPUT.pdf , which are the screenshots of the quiz I took on my android phone. PLEASE NOTE THAT MANY folders and subfolders were created , but I have only attached index.tsx file (in the app folder) as that is the only releavant file. PLEASE NOTE that I ran and played the quiz app multiple times, the answers I selected on page 2 and 3 of the QUIZOUTPUT.pdf , and the result on page 4 are not from the same iteration, hence there's a mismatch
# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
